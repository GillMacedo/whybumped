# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Fork the repo, make your change on a branch, and open a pull request. Only the maintainer merges to `main`.

## Setup

    make test
    make lint

You need Go 1.22 or newer. `make lint` also needs Claude Code. The dev container in `.devcontainer/` sets up both.

## Pull requests
- PRs go through an automatic check before a person reads them: changes over 30 lines need a linked open issue (`Closes #<number>`), code changes need tests, `make test` must pass, and a PR can have at most 800 changed lines.
- Keep each one to a single change, with tests.
- A new finding or explanation needs an integration test in `tests/` that must report it, and a close case that must stay quiet. Build the case with modules in `examples/proxy` so the test needs no network.
- Update `ROADMAP.md` and docs when relevant.
- Releases are automatic: a merge that changes what users install becomes a new version with its changelog line taken from the PR title, so write a title that says what changed for users. Edit `CHANGELOG.md` yourself only if you want different wording. Docs and CI changes wait for the next one.

## Working with AI agents
Agents are welcome. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` have the project's instructions, and `.claude/commands/` has common tasks. Say in your PR that an agent helped, and review the result yourself before submitting. You're responsible for what you submit.
